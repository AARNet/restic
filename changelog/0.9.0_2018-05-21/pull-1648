Enhancement: Ignore AWS permission denied error when creating a repository

It's not possible to use s3 backend scoped to a subdirectory(with specific permissions).
Restic doesn't try to create repository in a subdirectory, when 'bucket exists' of parent directory check fails due to permission issues.
