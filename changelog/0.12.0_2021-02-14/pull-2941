Enhancement: Speed up the repacking step of the `prune` command

The repack step of the `prune` command, which moves still used file parts into
new pack files such that the old ones can be garbage collected later on, now
processes multiple pack files in parallel. This is especially beneficial for
high latency backends or when using a fast network connection.
