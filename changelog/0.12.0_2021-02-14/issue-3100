Bugfix: Do not require gs bucket permissions when running `init`

Restic used to require bucket level permissions for the `gs` backend 
in order to initialize a restic repository.

It now allows a `gs` service account to initialize a repository if the
bucket does exist and the service account has permissions to write/read
to that bucket.
