Change: Deleting files on Google Drive now moves them to the trash

When deleting files on Google Drive via the `rclone` backend, restic used to
bypass the trash folder required that one used the `-o rclone.args` option to
enable usage of the trash folder. This ensured that deleted files in Google
Drive were not kept indefinitely in the trash folder. However, since Google
Drive's trash retention policy changed to deleting trashed files after 30 days,
this is no longer needed.

Restic now leaves it up to rclone and its configuration to use or not use the
trash folder when deleting files. The default is to use the trash folder, as
of rclone 1.53.2. To re-enable the restic 0.11 behavior, set the
`RCLONE_DRIVE_USE_TRASH` environment variable or change the rclone
configuration. See the rclone documentation for more details.
