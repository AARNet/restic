Enhancement: Warn if parent snapshot cannot be loaded during backup

During a backup restic uses the parent snapshot to check whether a file was
changed and has to be backed up again. For this check the backup has to read
the directories contained in the old snapshot. If a tree blob cannot be
loaded, restic now warns about this problem with the backup repository.
