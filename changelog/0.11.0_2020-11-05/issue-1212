Bugfix: Restore timestamps and permissions on intermediate directories

When using the `--include` option of the restore command, restic restored
timestamps and permissions only on directories selected by the include pattern.
Intermediate directories, which are necessary to restore files located in sub-
directories, were created with default permissions. We've fixed the restore
command to restore timestamps and permissions for these directories as well.
