Bugfix: Do not hang when run as a background job

Restic did hang on exit while restoring the terminal configuration when it was
started as a background job, for example using `restic ... &`. This has been
fixed by only restoring the terminal configuration when restic is interrupted
while reading a password from the terminal.
