Bugfix: Return error when exclude file cannot be read

A bug was found: when multiple exclude files were passed to restic and one of
them could not be read, an error was printed and restic continued, ignoring
even the existing exclude files. Now, an error message is printed and restic
aborts when an exclude file cannot be read.
