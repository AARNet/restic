Enhancement: Run command to get password

We've added the `--password-command` option which allows specifying a command
that restic runs every time the password for the repository is needed, so it
can be integrated with a password manager or keyring. The option can also be
set via the environment variable `$RESTIC_PASSWORD_COMMAND`.
