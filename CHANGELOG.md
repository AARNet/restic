This file describes changes relevant to all users that are made in each
released version of restic from the perspective of the user.

Important Changes in 0.X.Y
==========================

 * We've disabled handling SIGPIPE again. Turns out, writing to broken TCP
   connections also raised SIGPIPE, so restic exits on the first write to a
   broken connection. Instead, restic should retry the request.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1459
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1457
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1466

 * The command `diff` was added, it allows comparing two snapshots and listing
   all differences.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/11
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1460
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1462


Small changes
-------------

 * We've added code to detect old cache directories of repositories that
   haven't been used in a long time, restic now prints a note when it detects
   that such dirs exist. Also, the option `--cleanup-cache` was added to
   automatically remove such directories. That's not a problem because the
   cache will be rebuild once a repo is accessed again.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1436

 * The cache directory on Windows and Darwin was not correct, instead the
   directory `.cache` was used.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1454

 * By default, the access time for files and dirs is not saved any more. It is
   not possible to reliably disable updating the access time during a backup,
   so for the next backup the access time is different again. This means a lot
   of metadata is saved. If you want to save the access time anyway, pass
   `--with-atime` to the `backup` command.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1452

 * We've improved the s3 backend to work with DigitalOcean Spaces.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1459
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1457

 * The cancellation logic was improved, restic can now shut down cleanly when
   requested to do so (e.g. via ctrl+c).
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1439

Important Changes in 0.8.0
==========================

 * A vulnerability was found in the restic restorer, which allowed attackers in
   special circumstances to restore files to a location outside of the target
   directory. Due to the circumstances we estimate this to be a low-risk
   vulnerability, but urge all users to upgrade to the latest version of restic.

   Exploiting the vulnerability requires a Linux/Unix system which saves
   backups via restic and a Windows systems which restores files from the repo.
   In addition, the attackers need to be able to create create files with
   arbitrary names which are then saved to the restic repo. For example, by
   creating a file named "..\test.txt" (which is a perfectly legal filename on
   Linux) and restoring a snapshot containing this file on Windows, it would be
   written to the parent of the target directory.

   We'd like to thank Tyler Spivey for reporting this responsibly!

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1445

 * The s3 backend used the subdir `restic` within a bucket if no explicit path
   after the bucket name was specified. Since this version, restic does not use
   this default path any more. If you created a repo on s3 in a bucket without
   specifying a path within the bucket, you need to add `/restic` at the end of
   the repository specification to access your repo: `s3:s3.amazonaws.com/bucket/restic`
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1292
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1437

 * We've added a local cache for metadata so that restic doesn't need to load
   all metadata (snapshots, indexes, ...) from the repo each time it starts. By
   default the cache is active, but there's a new global option `--no-cache`
   that can be used to disable the cache. By deafult, the cache a standard
   cache folder for the OS, which can be overridden with `--cache-dir`.  The
   cache will automatically populate, indexes and snapshots are saved as they
   are loaded. Cache directories for repos that haven't been used recently can
   automatically be removed by restic with the `--cleanup-cache` option.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1040
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/29
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/738
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/282
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1287
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1436

 * A related change was to by default create pack files in the repo that
   contain either data or metadata, not both mixed together. This allows easy
   caching of only the metadata files. The next run of `restic prune` will
   untangle mixed files automatically.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1265

 * The Google Cloud Storage backend no longer requires the service account to
   have the `storage.buckets.get` permission ("Storage Admin" role) in `restic
   init` if the bucket already exists.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1281

 * Added support for rate limiting through `--limit-upload` and
   `--limit-download` flags.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1216
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1336
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1358

 * Failed backend requests are now automatically retried.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1353

 * We've added the `dump` command which prints a file from a snapshot to
   stdout. This can e.g. be used to restore files read with `backup --stdin`.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/510
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1346

Small changes
-------------

 * The directory structure in the fuse mount now exposes a symlink `latest`
   which points to the latest snapshot in that particular directory.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1249

 * The option `--compact` was added to the `forget` command to provide the same
   compact view as the `snapshots` command.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1269

 * We've re-enabled a workaround for `minio-go` (the library we're using to
   access s3 backends), this reduces memory usage.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1256
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1267

 * The sftp backend now prompts for the password if a password is necessary for
   login.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/448
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1270

 * The `generate` command has been added, which replaces the now removed
   commands `manpage` and `autocomplete`. This release of restic contains the
   most recent manpages in `doc/man` and the auto-completion files for bash and
   zsh in `doc/bash-completion.sh` and `doc/zsh-completion.zsh`
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1274
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1282

 * A bug was discovered in the library we're using to access Backblaze, it now
   reuses already established TCP connections which should be a lot faster and
   not cause network failures any more.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1291
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1301

 * Another bug in the `forget` command caused `prune` not to be run when
   `--prune` was specified without a policy, e.g. when only snapshot IDs that
   should be forgotten are listed manually. This is corrected now.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1317

 * The `check` command now explicetly prints `No errors were found` when no
   errors could be found.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1319
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1303

 * The fuse mount now has an `ids` subdirectory which contains the snapshots
   below their (short) IDs.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1102
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1299
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1320

 * The `backup` command was improved, it now caches the result of excludes for
   a directory.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1271
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1326

 * We've added the `--cacert` option which can be used to pass one (or more) CA
   certificates to restic. These are used in addition to the system CA
   certificates to verify HTTPS certificates (e.g. for the REST backend).
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1114
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1276

 * When the list of files/dirs to be saved is read from a file with
   `--files-from`, comment lines (starting with `#`) are now ignored.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1367
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1368

Important Changes in 0.7.3
==========================

 * For large backups stored in Google Cloud Storage, the `prune` command fails
   because listing only returns the first 1000 files. This has been corrected,
   no data is lost in the process. In addition, a plausibility check was added
   to `prune`.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1246
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1247


Important Changes in 0.7.2
==========================

 * We've added an official docker image and a Dockerfile to build this image in
   `docker/`.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1061

 * The git repository layout was changed to resemble the layout typically used
   in Go projects, we're not using `gb` for building restic any more and
   vendoring the dependencies is now taken care of by `dep`.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1126

 * We now support saving backups on Google Cloud Storage.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1134
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1052
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/211

 * We've added support for Microsoft Azure Blob Storage as a restic backend.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1149
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1059
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/609

 * In the course of supporting Microsoft Azure Blobe Storage Go 1.8 is now a
   requirement to build restic.

 * The `restore` command has been improved: When dirs are excluded (or not
   included) in a restore, they are not loaded from the repo any more.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1044

 * Name collisions are now resolved by appending a counter.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1179
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1209


Small changes
-------------

 * The `key` command now prompts for a password even if the original password
   to access a repo has been specified via the `RESTIC_PASSWORD` environment
   variable or a password file.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1132
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1133

 * Properly report errors when reading files with exclude patterns.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1144

 * We now automatically generate man pages for all restic commands, see the
   subdir `doc/man`.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/697
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1147

 * The `key remove` command was corrected and now works as documented.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1164

 * When a restic command other than `init` is used with a local repository and
   the repository directory does not exist, restic creates the directory
   structure. That's an error, only the `init` command should create the dir.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1167
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1182

 * Restic now prints stats on all BSD systems (not only on darwin) when SIGINFO
   is received (usually when ctrl+t is pressed).
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1203
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1082#issuecomment-326279920

 * Since a few releases restic had the ability to write profiling files for
   memory and CPU usage when `debug` is enabled. It was discovered that when
   restic is interrupted (ctrl+c is pressed), the proper shutdown hook is not
   run. This is now corrected.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1191

 * A new option `--exclude-caches` was added that allows excluding cache
   directories (that are tagged as such). This is a special case of a more
   generic option `--exclude-if-present` which excludes a directory if a file
   with a specific name (and contents) is present.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/317
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1170
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1224

 * The `forget` command now has an option `--group-by` that allows flexible
   grouping policies.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1196

 * The date and time restic records for a new backup can now be specified
   externally by passing `--time` to the `backup` command.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1205

 * The option `--compact` was added to the `snapshots` command to get a better
   overview of the snapshots in a repo. It limits each snapshot to a single
   line.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1218
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1223


Important Changes in 0.7.1
==========================

 * The `migrate` command for chaning the `s3legacy` layout to the `default`
   layout for s3 backends has been improved: It can now be restarted with
   `restic migrate --force s3_layout` and automatically retries operations on
   error.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1073
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1075

Small changes
-------------

 * The local and sftp backends now create the subdirs below `data/` on
   open/init. This way, restic makes sure that they always exist. This is
   connected to an issue for the sftp server:
   https://github.com/restic/rest-server/pull/11#issuecomment-309879710
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1055
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1077
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1105

 * When no S3 credentials are specified in the environment variables, restic
   now tries to load credentials from an IAM instance profile when the s3
   backend is used.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1067
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1086

 * On Darwin and FreeBSD, restic now prints stats when SIGINFO is received
   (usually when ctrl+t is pressed).
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1082

 * The dependencies have been updated.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1108
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1124

 * A bug was found (and corrected) in the index rebuilding after prune, which
   led to indexes which include blobs that were not present in the repo any
   more. There were already checks in place which detected this situation and
   aborted with an error message. A new run of either `prune` or
   `rebuild-index` corrected the index files. This is now fixed and a test has
   been added to detect this.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1115

 * Errors for chmod() on Unix for filesystems which do not support it (e.g. smb
   mounted via gvfs) are now ignored.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1080
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1112

 * The semantic for the `--tags` option to `forget` and `snapshots` was
   clarified:
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1081
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1090

Important Changes in 0.7.0
==========================

 * New "swift" backend: A new backend for the OpenStack Swift cloud storage
   protocol has been added, https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Swift
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/975
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/648

 * New "b2" backend: A new backend for Backblaze B2 cloud storage
   service has been added, https://www.backblaze.com
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/512
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/978

 * Improved performance for the `find` command: Restic recognizes paths it has
   already checked for the files in question, so the number of backend requests
   is reduced a lot.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/989
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/993

 * Improved performance for the fuse mount: Listing directories which contain
   large files now is significantly faster.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/998

 * The default layout for the s3 backend is now `default` (instead of
   `s3legacy`). Also, there's a new `migrate` command to convert an existing
   repo, it can be run like this: `restic migrate s3_layout`
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/965
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1004

 * The fuse mount now has two more directories: `tags` contains a subdir for
   each tag, which in turn contains only the snapshots that have this tag. The
   subdir `hosts` contains a subdir for each host that has a snapshot, and the
   subdir contains the snapshots for that host.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/636
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1050

Small changes
-------------

 * For the s3 backend we're back to using the high-level API the s3 client
   library for uploading data, a few users reported dropped connections (which
   the library will automatically retry now).
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1013
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1023
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1025

 * The `prune` command has been improved and will now remove invalid pack
   files, for example files that have not been uploaded completely because a
   backup was interrupted.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1029
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1036

 * restic now tries to detect when an invalid/unknown backend is used and
   returns an error message.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1021
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1070

Important Changes in 0.6.1
==========================

This is mostly a bugfix release and only contains small changes:

 * We've fixed a bug where `rebuild-index` would corrupt the index when used
   with the s3 backend together with the `default` layout. This is not the
   default setting.

 * Backends based on HTTP now allow several idle connections in parallel. This
   is especially important for the REST backend, which (when used with a local
   server) may create a lot connections and exhaust available ports quickly.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/985
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/986

 * Regular status report: We've removed the status report that was printed
   every 10 seconds when restic is run non-interactively. You can still force
   reporting the current status by sending a `USR1` signal to the process.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/974

 * The `build.go` now strips the temporary directory used for compilation from
   the binary. This is the first step in enabling reproducible builds.
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/981

Important Changes in 0.6.0
==========================

Consistent forget policy
------------------------

The `forget` command was corrected to be more consistent in which snapshots are
to be forgotten. It is possible that the new code removes more snapshots than
before, so please review what would be deleted by using the `--dry-run` option.

https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/957
https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/953

Unified repository layout
-------------------------

Up to now the s3 backend used a special repository layout. We've decided to
unify the repository layout and implemented the default layout also for the s3
backend. For creating a new repository on s3 with the default layout, use
`restic -o s3.layout=default init`. For further commands the option is not
necessary any more, restic will automatically detect the correct layout to use.
A future version will switch to the default layout for new repositories.

https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/966
https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/965

Memory and time improvements for the s3 backend
-----------------------------------------------

We've updated the library used for accessing s3, switched to using a lower
level API and added caching for some requests. This lead to a decrease in
memory usage and a great speedup. In addition, we added benchmark functions for
all backends, so we can track improvements over time. The Continuous
Integration test service we're using (Travis) now runs the s3 backend tests not
only against a Minio server, but also against the Amazon s3 live service, so we
should be notified of any regressions much sooner.
