 * Bugfix #1801: Add limiting bandwidth to the rclone backend

   The rclone backend did not respect `--limit-upload` or `--limit-download`. Oftentimes it's
   not necessary to use this, as the limiting in rclone itself should be used because it gives much
   better results, but in case a remote instance of rclone is used (e.g. called via ssh), it is still
   relevant to limit the bandwidth from restic to rclone.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1801

 * Bugfix #1822: Allow uploading large files to MS Azure

   Sometimes, restic creates files to be uploaded to the repository which are quite large, e.g.
   when saving directories with many entries or very large files. The MS Azure API does not allow
   uploading files larger that 256MiB directly, rather restic needs to upload them in blocks of
   100MiB. This is now implemented.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1822

 * Bugfix #1825: Correct `find` to not skip snapshots

   Under certain circumstances, the `find` command was found to skip snapshots containing
   directories with files to look for when the directories haven't been modified at all, and were
   already printed as part of a different snapshot. This is now corrected.

   In addition, we've switched to our own matching/pattern implementation, so now things like
   `restic find "/home/user/foo/**/main.go"` are possible.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1825
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1823

 * Bugfix #1833: Fix caching files on error

   During `check` it may happen that different threads access the same file in the backend, which
   is then downloaded into the cache only once. When that fails, only the thread which is
   responsible for downloading the file signals the correct error. The other threads just assume
   that the file has been downloaded successfully and then get an error when they try to access the
   cached file.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1833

 * Bugfix #1834: Resolve deadlock

   When the "scanning" process restic runs to find out how much data there is does not finish before
   the backup itself is done, restic stops doing anything. This is resolved now.

Details
-------

 * Bugfix #1608: Respect time stamp for new backup when reading from stdin

   When reading backups from stdin (via `restic backup --stdin`), restic now uses the time stamp
   for the new backup passed in `--time`.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1608
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1703

 * Bugfix #1652: Ignore/remove invalid lock files

   This corrects a bug introduced recently: When an invalid lock file in the repo is encountered
   (e.g. if the file is empty), the code used to ignore that, but now returns the error. Now, invalid
   files are ignored for the normal lock check, and removed when `restic unlock --remove-all` is
   run.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1652
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1653

 * Bugfix #1730: Ignore sockets for restore

   We've received a report and correct the behavior in which the restore code aborted restoring a
   directory when a socket was encountered. Unix domain socket files cannot be restored (they are
   created on the fly once a process starts listening). The error handling was corrected, and in
   addition we're now ignoring sockets during restore.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1730
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1731

 * Bugfix #1684: Fix backend tests for rest-server

   The REST server for restic now requires an explicit parameter (`--no-auth`) if no
   authentication should be allowed. This is fixed in the tests.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1684

 * Bugfix #1745: Correctly parse the argument to --tls-client-cert

   Previously, the --tls-client-cert method attempt to read ARGV[1] (hardcoded) instead of the
   argument that was passed to it. This has been corrected.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1745
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1746

 * Enhancement #1433: Support UTF-16 encoding and process Byte Order Mark

   On Windows, text editors commonly leave a Byte Order Mark at the beginning of the file to define
   which encoding is used (oftentimes UTF-16). We've added code to support processing the BOMs in
   text files, like the exclude files, the password file and the file passed via `--files-from`.
   This does not apply to any file being saved in a backup, those are not touched and archived as they
   are.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1738
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1748

 * Enhancement #1561: Allow using rclone to access other services

   We've added the ability to use rclone to store backup data on all backends that it supports. This
   was done in collaboration with Nick, the author of rclone. You can now use it to first configure a
   service, then restic manages the rest (starting and stopping rclone). For details, please see
   the manual.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1561
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1657
   https://rclone.org

 * Enhancement #1665: Improve cache handling for `restic check`

   For safety reasons, restic does not use a local metadata cache for the `restic check` command,
   so that data is loaded from the repository and restic can check it's in good condition. When the
   cache is disabled, restic will fetch each tiny blob needed for checking the integrity using a
   separate backend request. For non-local backends, that will take a long time, and depending on
   the backend (e.g. B2) may also be much more expensive.

   This PR adds a few commits which will change the behavior as follows:

   * When `restic check` is called without any additional parameters, it will build a new cache in a
   temporary directory, which is removed at the end of the check. This way, we'll get readahead for
   metadata files (so restic will fetch the whole file when the first blob from the file is
   requested), but all data is freshly fetched from the storage backend. This is the default
   behavior and will work for almost all users.

   * When `restic check` is called with `--with-cache`, the default on-disc cache is used. This
   behavior hasn't changed since the cache was introduced.

   * When `--no-cache` is specified, restic falls back to the old behavior, and read all tiny blobs
   in separate requests.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1694
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1696

 * Enhancement #1721: Add `cache` command to list cache dirs

   The command `cache` was added, it allows listing restic's cache directoriers together with
   the last usage. It also allows removing old cache dirs without having to access a repo, via
   `restic cache --cleanup`

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1721
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1749

 * Enhancement #1758: Allow saving OneDrive folders in Windows

   Restic now contains a bugfix to two libraries, which allows saving OneDrive folders in
   Windows. In order to use the newer versions of the libraries, the minimal version required to
   compile restic is now Go 1.9.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1758
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1765

 * Enhancement #549: Rework archiver code

   The core archiver code and the complementary code for the `backup` command was rewritten
   completely. This resolves very annoying issues such as 549. The first backup with this release
   of restic will likely result in all files being re-read locally, so it will take a lot longer. The
   next backup after that will be fast again.

   Basically, with the old code, restic took the last path component of each to-be-saved file or
   directory as the top-level file/directory within the snapshot. This meant that when called as
   `restic backup /home/user/foo`, the snapshot would contain the files in the directory
   `/home/user/foo` as `/foo`.

   This is not the case any more with the new archiver code. Now, restic works very similar to what
   `tar` does: When restic is called with an absolute path to save, then it'll preserve the
   directory structure within the snapshot. For the example above, the snapshot would contain
   the files in the directory within `/home/user/foo` in the snapshot. For relative
   directories, it only preserves the relative path components. So `restic backup user/foo`
   will save the files as `/user/foo` in the snapshot.

   While we were at it, the status display and notification system was completely rewritten. By
   default, restic now shows which files are currently read (unless `--quiet` is specified) in a
   multi-line status display.

   The `backup` command also gained a new option: `--verbose`. It can be specified once (which
   prints a bit more detail what restic is doing) or twice (which prints a line for each
   file/directory restic encountered, together with some statistics).

   Another issue that was resolved is the new code only reads two files at most. The old code would
   read way too many files in parallel, thereby slowing down the backup process on spinning discs a
   lot.

 * Enhancement #1552: Use Google Application Default credentials

   Google provide libraries to generate appropriate credentials with various fallback
   sources. This change uses the library to generate our GCS client, which allows us to make use of
   these extra methods.

   This should be backward compatible with previous restic behaviour while adding the
   additional capabilities to auth from Google's internal metadata endpoints. For users
   running restic in GCP this can make authentication far easier than it was before.

   https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials

 * Enhancement #1477: Accept AWS_SESSION_TOKEN for the s3 backend

   Before, it was not possible to use s3 backend with AWS temporary security credentials(with
   AWS_SESSION_TOKEN). This change gives higher priority to credentials.EnvAWS credentials
   provider.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1477
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1479
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1647

 * Enhancement #1648: Ignore AWS permission denied error when creating a repository

   It's not possible to use s3 backend scoped to a subdirectory(with specific permissions).
   Restic doesn't try to create repository in a subdirectory, when 'bucket exists' of parent
   directory check fails due to permission issues.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1648

 * Enhancement #1649: Add illumos/Solaris support

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1649

 * Enhancement #1709: Improve messages `restic check` prints

   Some messages `restic check` prints are not really errors, so from now on restic does not treat
   them as errors any more and exits cleanly.

   https://forum.restic.net/t/what-is-the-standard-procedure-to-follow-if-a-backup-or-restore-is-interrupted/571/2

 * Enhancement #827: Add --new-password-file flag for non-interactive password changes

   This makes it possible to change a repository password without being prompted.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/827
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1720
   https://forum.restic.net/t/changing-repo-password-without-prompt/591

 * Enhancement #1735: Allow keeping a time range of snaphots

   We've added the `--keep-within` option to the `forget` command. It instructs restic to keep
   all snapshots within the given duration since the newest snapshot. For example, running
   `restic forget --keep-within 5m7d` will keep all snapshots which have been made in the five
   months and seven days since the latest snapshot.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1735

 * Enhancement #1782: Use default AWS credentials chain for S3 backend

   Adds support for file credentials to the S3 backend (e.g. ~/.aws/credentials), and reorders
   the credentials chain for the S3 backend to match AWS's standard, which is static credentials,
   env vars, credentials file, and finally remote.

Changelog for restic 0.8.3 (2018-02-26)
=======================================

The following sections list the changes in restic 0.8.3 relevant to
restic users. The changes are ordered by importance.

Summary
-------

 * Fix #1633: Fixed unexpected 'pack file cannot be listed' error
 * Fix #1641: Ignore files with invalid names in the repo
 * Fix #1638: Handle errors listing files in the backend
 * Enh #1497: Add --read-data-subset flag to check command

 * Enh #1634: Upgrade B2 client library, reduce HTTP requests

Details
-------

 * Bugfix #1633: Fixed unexpected 'pack file cannot be listed' error

   Due to a regression introduced in 0.8.2, the `rebuild-index` and `prune` commands failed to
   read pack files with size of 587, 588, 589 or 590 bytes.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1633
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1635

 * Bugfix #1641: Ignore files with invalid names in the repo

   The release 0.8.2 introduced a bug: when restic encounters files in the repo which do not have a
   valid name, it tries to load a file with a name of lots of zeroes instead of ignoring it. This is now
   resolved, invalid file names are just ignored.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1641
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1643
   https://forum.restic.net/t/help-fixing-repo-no-such-file/485/3

 * Bugfix #1638: Handle errors listing files in the backend

   A user reported in the forum that restic completes a backup although a concurrent `prune`
   operation was running. A few error messages were printed, but the backup was attempted and
   completed successfully. No error code was returned.

   This should not happen: The repository is exclusively locked during `prune`, so when `restic
   backup` is run in parallel, it should abort and return an error code instead.

   It was found that the bug was in the code introduced only recently, which retries a List()
   operation on the backend should that fail. It is now corrected.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1638
   https://forum.restic.net/t/restic-backup-returns-0-exit-code-when-already-locked/484

 * Enhancement #1497: Add --read-data-subset flag to check command

   This change introduces ability to check integrity of a subset of repository data packs. This
   can be used to spread integrity check of larger repositories over a period of time.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1497
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1556

 * Enhancement #1560: Retry all repository file download errors

   Restic will now retry failed downloads, similar to other operations.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1560

 * Enhancement #1623: Don't check for presence of files in the backend before writing

   Before, all backend implementations were required to return an error if the file that is to be
   written already exists in the backend. For most backends, that means making a request (e.g. via
   HTTP) and returning an error when the file already exists.

   This is not accurate, the file could have been created between the HTTP request testing for it,
   and when writing starts, so we've relaxed this requeriment, which saves one additional HTTP
   request per newly added file.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1623

 * Enhancement #1634: Upgrade B2 client library, reduce HTTP requests

   We've upgraded the B2 client library restic uses to access BackBlaze B2. This reduces the
   number of HTTP requests needed to upload a new file from two to one, which should improve
   throughput to B2.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1634

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1506
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1511

 * Bugfix #1512: Restore directory permissions as the last step

   This change allows restoring into directories that were not writable during backup. Before,
   restic created the directory, set the read-only mode and then failed to create files in the
   directory. This change now restores the directory (with its permissions) as the very last
   step.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1512
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1536

 * Bugfix #1528: Correctly create missing subdirs in data/

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1528
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1529

 * Bugfix #1590: Strip spaces for lines read via --files-from

   Leading and trailing spaces in lines read via `--files-from` are now stripped, so it behaves
   the same as with lines read via `--exclude-file`.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1590
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1613

 * Bugfix #1589: Complete intermediate index upload

   After a user posted a comprehensive report of what he observed, we were able to find a bug and
   correct it: During backup, restic uploads so-called "intermediate" index files. When the
   backup finishes during a transfer of such an intermediate index, the upload is cancelled, but
   the backup is finished without an error. This leads to an inconsistent state, where the
   snapshot references data that is contained in the repo, but is not referenced in any index.

   The situation can be resolved by building a new index with `rebuild-index`, but looks very
   confusing at first. Since all the data got uploaded to the repo successfully, there was no risk
   of data loss, just minor inconvenience for our users.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1589
   https://forum.restic.net/t/error-loading-tree-check-prune-and-forget-gives-error-b2-backend/406

 * Bugfix #1594: Google Cloud Storage: Use generic HTTP transport

   It was discovered that the Google Cloud Storage backend did not use the generic HTTP transport,
   so things such as bandwidth limiting with `--limit-upload` did not work. This is resolved now.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1594

 * Bugfix #1595: Backup: Remove bandwidth display

   This commit removes the bandwidth displayed during backup process. It is misleading and
   seldomly correct, because it's neither the "read bandwidth" (only for the very first backup)
   nor the "upload bandwidth". Many users are confused about (and rightly so), c.f. #1581, #1033,
   #1591

   We'll eventually replace this display with something more relevant when the new archiver code
   is ready.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1595

 * Enhancement #1522: Add support for TLS client certificate authentication

   Support has been added for using a TLS client certificate for authentication to HTTP based
   backend. A file containing the PEM encoded private key and certificate can be set using the
   `--tls-client-cert` option.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1522
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1524

 * Enhancement #1541: Reduce number of remote requests during repository check

   This change eliminates redundant remote repository calls and significantly improves
   repository check time.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1541
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1548

 * Enhancement #1567: Reduce number of backend requests for rebuild-index and prune

   We've found a way to reduce then number of backend requests for the `rebuild-index` and `prune`
   operations. This significantly speeds up the operations for high-latency backends.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1567
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1574
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1575

 * Enhancement #1507: Only reload snapshots once per minute for fuse mount

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1507

 * Enhancement #1538: Reduce memory allocations for querying the index

   This change reduces the internal memory allocations when the index data structures in memory
   are queried if a blob (part of a file) already exists in the repo. It should speed up backup a bit,
   and maybe even reduce RAM usage.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1538

 * Enhancement #1549: Speed up querying across indices and scanning existing files

   This change increases the whenever a blob (part of a file) is searched for in a restic
   repository. This will reduce cpu usage some when backing up files already backed up by restic.
   Cpu usage is further decreased when scanning files.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1549

 * Enhancement #1554: Fuse/mount: Correctly handle EOF, add template option

   We've added the `--snapshot-template` string, which can be used to specify a template for a
   snapshot directory. In addition, accessing data after the end of a file via the fuse mount is now
   handled correctly.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1554

 * Enhancement #1564: Don't terminate ssh on SIGINT

   We've reworked the code which runs the `ssh` login for the sftp backend so that it can prompt for a
   password (if needed) but does not exit when the user presses CTRL+C (SIGINT) e.g. during
   backup. This allows restic to properly shut down when it receives SIGINT and remove the lock
   file from the repo, afterwards exiting the `ssh` process.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1564
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1588

 * Enhancement #1579: Retry Backend.List() in case of errors

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1579

 * Enhancement #1584: Limit index file size

   Before, restic would create a single new index file on `prune` or `rebuild-index`, this may
   lead to memory problems when this huge index is created and loaded again. We're now limiting the
   size of the index file, and split newly created index files into several smaller ones. This
   allows restic to be more memory-efficient.

 * Bugfix #1454: Correct cache dir location for Windows and Darwin

   The cache directory on Windows and Darwin was not correct, instead the directory `.cache` was
   used.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1454

 * Bugfix #1459: Disable handling SIGPIPE

   We've disabled handling SIGPIPE again. Turns out, writing to broken TCP connections also
   raised SIGPIPE, so restic exits on the first write to a broken connection. Instead, restic
   should retry the request.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1459

 * Change #1452: Do not save atime by default

   By default, the access time for files and dirs is not saved any more. It is not possible to
   reliably disable updating the access time during a backup, so for the next backup the access
   time is different again. This means a lot of metadata is saved. If you want to save the access time
   anyway, pass `--with-atime` to the `backup` command.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1452

 * Enhancement #1436: Add code to detect old cache directories

   We've added code to detect old cache directories of repositories that haven't been used in a
   long time, restic now prints a note when it detects that such dirs exist. Also, the option
   `--cleanup-cache` was added to automatically remove such directories. That's not a problem
   because the cache will be rebuild once a repo is accessed again.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1436

 * Enhancement #1439: Improve cancellation logic

   The cancellation logic was improved, restic can now shut down cleanly when requested to do so
   (e.g. via ctrl+c).

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1439

 * Enhancement #11: Add the `diff` command

   The command `diff` was added, it allows comparing two snapshots and listing all differences.

Details

 * Security #1445: Prevent writing outside the target directory during restore

   A vulnerability was found in the restic restorer, which allowed attackers in special
   circumstances to restore files to a location outside of the target directory. Due to the
   circumstances we estimate this to be a low-risk vulnerability, but urge all users to upgrade to
   the latest version of restic.

   Exploiting the vulnerability requires a Linux/Unix system which saves backups via restic and
   a Windows systems which restores files from the repo. In addition, the attackers need to be able
   to create create files with arbitrary names which are then saved to the restic repo. For
   example, by creating a file named "..\test.txt" (which is a perfectly legal filename on Linux)
   and restoring a snapshot containing this file on Windows, it would be written to the parent of
   the target directory.

   We'd like to thank Tyler Spivey for reporting this responsibly!

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1445

 * Bugfix #1256: Re-enable workaround for S3 backend

   We've re-enabled a workaround for `minio-go` (the library we're using to access s3 backends),
   this reduces memory usage.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1256
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1267

 * Bugfix #1291: Reuse backend TCP connections to BackBlaze B2

   A bug was discovered in the library we're using to access Backblaze, it now reuses already
   established TCP connections which should be a lot faster and not cause network failures any
   more.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1291
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1301

 * Bugfix #1317: Run prune when `forget --prune` is called with just snapshot IDs

   A bug in the `forget` command caused `prune` not to be run when `--prune` was specified without a
   policy, e.g. when only snapshot IDs that should be forgotten are listed manually.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1317

 * Bugfix #1437: Remove implicit path `/restic` for the s3 backend

   The s3 backend used the subdir `restic` within a bucket if no explicit path after the bucket name
   was specified. Since this version, restic does not use this default path any more. If you
   created a repo on s3 in a bucket without specifying a path within the bucket, you need to add
   `/restic` at the end of the repository specification to access your repo:
   `s3:s3.amazonaws.com/bucket/restic`

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1292
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1437

 * Enhancement #1102: Add subdirectory `ids` to fuse mount

   The fuse mount now has an `ids` subdirectory which contains the snapshots below their (short)
   IDs.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1102
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1299
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1320

 * Enhancement #1114: Add `--cacert` to specify TLS certificates to check against

   We've added the `--cacert` option which can be used to pass one (or more) CA certificates to
   restic. These are used in addition to the system CA certificates to verify HTTPS certificates
   (e.g. for the REST backend).

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1114
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1276

 * Enhancement #1216: Add upload/download limiting

   We've added support for rate limiting through `--limit-upload` and `--limit-download`
   flags.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1216
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1336
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1358

 * Enhancement #1271: Cache results for excludes for `backup`

   The `backup` command now caches the result of excludes for a directory.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1271
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1326

 * Enhancement #1274: Add `generate` command, replaces `manpage` and `autocomplete`

   The `generate` command has been added, which replaces the now removed commands `manpage` and
   `autocomplete`. This release of restic contains the most recent manpages in `doc/man` and the
   auto-completion files for bash and zsh in `doc/bash-completion.sh` and
   `doc/zsh-completion.zsh`

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1274
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1282

 * Enhancement #1367: Allow comments in files read from via `--file-from`

   When the list of files/dirs to be saved is read from a file with `--files-from`, comment lines
   (starting with `#`) are now ignored.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1367
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1368

 * Enhancement #448: Sftp backend prompts for password

   The sftp backend now prompts for the password if a password is necessary for login.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/448
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1270

 * Enhancement #510: Add `dump` command

   We've added the `dump` command which prints a file from a snapshot to stdout. This can e.g. be
   used to restore files read with `backup --stdin`.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/510
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1346

 * Enhancement #1040: Add local metadata cache

   We've added a local cache for metadata so that restic doesn't need to load all metadata
   (snapshots, indexes, ...) from the repo each time it starts. By default the cache is active, but
   there's a new global option `--no-cache` that can be used to disable the cache. By deafult, the
   cache a standard cache folder for the OS, which can be overridden with `--cache-dir`. The cache
   will automatically populate, indexes and snapshots are saved as they are loaded. Cache
   directories for repos that haven't been used recently can automatically be removed by restic
   with the `--cleanup-cache` option.

   A related change was to by default create pack files in the repo that contain either data or
   metadata, not both mixed together. This allows easy caching of only the metadata files. The
   next run of `restic prune` will untangle mixed files automatically.

 * Enhancement #1249: Add `latest` symlink in fuse mount

   The directory structure in the fuse mount now exposes a symlink `latest` which points to the
   latest snapshot in that particular directory.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1249

 * Enhancement #1269: Add `--compact` to `forget` command

   The option `--compact` was added to the `forget` command to provide the same compact view as the
   `snapshots` command.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1269

 * Enhancement #1281: Google Cloud Storage backend needs less permissions

   The Google Cloud Storage backend no longer requires the service account to have the
   `storage.buckets.get` permission ("Storage Admin" role) in `restic init` if the bucket
   already exists.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1281

 * Enhancement #1319: Make `check` print `no errors found` explicitly

   The `check` command now explicetly prints `No errors were found` when no errors could be found.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1303
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1319

 * Enhancement #1353: Retry failed backend requests

Summary
-------

 * Fix #1246: List all files stored in Google Cloud Storage

Details
-------

 * Bugfix #1246: List all files stored in Google Cloud Storage

   For large backups stored in Google Cloud Storage, the `prune` command fails because listing
   only returns the first 1000 files. This has been corrected, no data is lost in the process. In
   addition, a plausibility check was added to `prune`.

 * Enh #1205: Allow specifying time/date for a backup with `--time`

Details
-------

 * Bugfix #1167: Do not create a local repo unless `init` is used

   When a restic command other than `init` is used with a local repository and the repository
   directory does not exist, restic creates the directory structure. That's an error, only the
   `init` command should create the dir.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1167
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1182

 * Bugfix #1164: Make the `key remove` command behave as documented

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1164

 * Bugfix #1191: Make sure to write profiling files on interrupt

   Since a few releases restic had the ability to write profiling files for memory and CPU usage
   when `debug` is enabled. It was discovered that when restic is interrupted (ctrl+c is
   pressed), the proper shutdown hook is not run. This is now corrected.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1191

 * Enhancement #1132: Make `key` command always prompt for a password

   The `key` command now prompts for a password even if the original password to access a repo has
   been specified via the `RESTIC_PASSWORD` environment variable or a password file.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1132
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1133

 * Enhancement #1179: Resolve name conflicts, append a counter

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1179
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1209

 * Enhancement #1218: Add `--compact` to `snapshots` command

   The option `--compact` was added to the `snapshots` command to get a better overview of the
   snapshots in a repo. It limits each snapshot to a single line.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1218
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1223

 * Enhancement #317: Add `--exclude-caches` and `--exclude-if-present`

   A new option `--exclude-caches` was added that allows excluding cache directories (that are
   tagged as such). This is a special case of a more generic option `--exclude-if-present` which
   excludes a directory if a file with a specific name (and contents) is present.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/317
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1170

 * Enhancement #1044: Improve `restore`, do not traverse/load excluded directories

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1044

 * Enhancement #1061: Add Dockerfile and official Docker image

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1061

 * Enhancement #1126: Use the standard Go git repository layout, use `dep` for vendoring

   The git repository layout was changed to resemble the layout typically used in Go projects,
   we're not using `gb` for building restic any more and vendoring the dependencies is now taken
   care of by `dep`.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1126

 * Enhancement #1134: Add support for storing backups on Google Cloud Storage

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/211
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1134
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1052

 * Enhancement #1144: Properly report errors when reading files with exclude patterns

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1144

 * Enhancement #1149: Add support for storing backups on Microsoft Azure Blob Storage

   The library we're using to access the service requires Go 1.8, so restic now needs at least Go
   1.8.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/609
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1149
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1059

Changelog for restic 0.7.1 (2017-07-22)
=======================================

The following sections list the changes in restic 0.7.1 relevant to
restic users. The changes are ordered by importance.

Summary
-------

 * Fix #1115: Fix `prune`, only include existing files in indexes
 * Enh #1055: Create subdirs below `data/` for local/sftp backends
 * Enh #1067: Allow loading credentials for s3 from IAM
 * Enh #1073: Add `migrate` cmd to migrate from `s3legacy` to `default` layout
 * Enh #1081: Clarify semantic for `--tasg` for the `forget` command
 * Enh #1080: Ignore chmod() errors on filesystems which do not support it
 * Enh #1082: Print stats on SIGINFO on Darwin and FreeBSD (ctrl+t)

Details
-------

 * Bugfix #1115: Fix `prune`, only include existing files in indexes

   A bug was found (and corrected) in the index rebuilding after prune, which led to indexes which
   include blobs that were not present in the repo any more. There were already checks in place
   which detected this situation and aborted with an error message. A new run of either `prune` or
   `rebuild-index` corrected the index files. This is now fixed and a test has been added to detect
   this.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1115

 * Enhancement #1055: Create subdirs below `data/` for local/sftp backends

   The local and sftp backends now create the subdirs below `data/` on open/init. This way, restic
   makes sure that they always exist. This is connected to an issue for the sftp server.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1105

 * Enhancement #1067: Allow loading credentials for s3 from IAM

   When no S3 credentials are specified in the environment variables, restic now tries to load
   credentials from an IAM instance profile when the s3 backend is used.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1067
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1086

 * Enhancement #1073: Add `migrate` cmd to migrate from `s3legacy` to `default` layout

   The `migrate` command for changing the `s3legacy` layout to the `default` layout for s3
   backends has been improved: It can now be restarted with `restic migrate --force s3_layout`
   and automatically retries operations on error.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1073
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1075

Changelog for restic 0.7.0 (2017-07-01)
=======================================

The following sections list the changes in restic 0.7.0 relevant to
restic users. The changes are ordered by importance.

Summary
-------

 * Fix #1013: Switch back to using the high-level minio-go API for s3
 * Fix #965: Switch to `default` repo layout for the s3 backend
 * Enh #1021: Detect invalid backend name and print error
 * Enh #1029: Remove invalid pack files when `prune` is run
 * Enh #512: Add Backblaze B2 backend
 * Enh #636: Add dirs `tags` and `hosts` to fuse mount
 * Enh #989: Improve performance of the `find` command
 * Enh #975: Add new backend for OpenStack Swift
 * Enh #998: Improve performance of the fuse mount

Details
-------

 * Bugfix #1013: Switch back to using the high-level minio-go API for s3

   For the s3 backend we're back to using the high-level API the s3 client library for uploading
   data, a few users reported dropped connections (which the library will automatically retry
   now).

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1013
   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1023
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1025

 * Bugfix #965: Switch to `default` repo layout for the s3 backend

   The default layout for the s3 backend is now `default` (instead of `s3legacy`). Also, there's a
   new `migrate` command to convert an existing repo, it can be run like this: `restic migrate
   s3_layout`

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/965
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1004

 * Enhancement #1021: Detect invalid backend name and print error

   Restic now tries to detect when an invalid/unknown backend is used and returns an error
   message.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1021
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1070

 * Enhancement #1029: Remove invalid pack files when `prune` is run

   The `prune` command has been improved and will now remove invalid pack files, for example files
   that have not been uploaded completely because a backup was interrupted.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/1029
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1036

 * Enhancement #512: Add Backblaze B2 backend

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/512
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/978

 * Enhancement #636: Add dirs `tags` and `hosts` to fuse mount

   The fuse mount now has two more directories: `tags` contains a subdir for each tag, which in turn
   contains only the snapshots that have this tag. The subdir `hosts` contains a subdir for each
   host that has a snapshot, and the subdir contains the snapshots for that host.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/636
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1050

 * Enhancement #989: Improve performance of the `find` command

   Improved performance for the `find` command: Restic recognizes paths it has already checked
   for the files in question, so the number of backend requests is reduced a lot.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/989
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/993

 * Enhancement #975: Add new backend for OpenStack Swift

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/975
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/648

 * Enhancement #998: Improve performance of the fuse mount

   Listing directories which contain large files now is significantly faster.

Changelog for restic 0.6.1 (2017-06-01)
=======================================

The following sections list the changes in restic 0.6.1 relevant to
restic users. The changes are ordered by importance.

Summary
-------

 * Enh #985: Allow multiple parallel idle HTTP connections
 * Enh #981: Remove temporary path from binary in `build.go`
 * Enh #974: Remove regular status reports

Details
-------

 * Enhancement #985: Allow multiple parallel idle HTTP connections

   Backends based on HTTP now allow several idle connections in parallel. This is especially
   important for the REST backend, which (when used with a local server) may create a lot
   connections and exhaust available ports quickly.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/985
   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/986

 * Enhancement #981: Remove temporary path from binary in `build.go`

   The `build.go` now strips the temporary directory used for compilation from the binary. This
   is the first step in enabling reproducible builds.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/981

 * Enhancement #974: Remove regular status reports

   Regular status report: We've removed the status report that was printed every 10 seconds when
   restic is run non-interactively. You can still force reporting the current status by sending a
   `USR1` signal to the process.

   https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/974


Changelog for restic 0.6.0 (2017-05-29)
=======================================

 * Enhancement #957: Make `forget` consistent

   The `forget` command was corrected to be more consistent in which snapshots are to be
   forgotten. It is possible that the new code removes more snapshots than before, so please
   review what would be deleted by using the `--dry-run` option.

 * Enhancement #966: Unify repository layout for all backends

   Up to now the s3 backend used a special repository layout. We've decided to unify the repository
   layout and implemented the default layout also for the s3 backend. For creating a new
   repository on s3 with the default layout, use `restic -o s3.layout=default init`. For further
   commands the option is not necessary any more, restic will automatically detect the correct
   layout to use. A future version will switch to the default layout for new repositories.

 * Enhancement #962: Improve memory and runtime for the s3 backend

   We've updated the library used for accessing s3, switched to using a lower level API and added
   caching for some requests. This lead to a decrease in memory usage and a great speedup. In
   addition, we added benchmark functions for all backends, so we can track improvements over
   time. The Continuous Integration test service we're using (Travis) now runs the s3 backend
   tests not only against a Minio server, but also against the Amazon s3 live service, so we should
   be notified of any regressions much sooner.
