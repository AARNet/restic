Welcome! If you have a question or are unsure if you should open an issue,
please use the forum instead!

The forum is a better place for questions about restic or general suggestions
and topics, e.g. usage or documentation questions! This issue tracker is mainly
for tracking bugs and feature requests directly relating to the development of
the software itself, rather than the project.

Thanks for understanding, and for contributing to the project!
