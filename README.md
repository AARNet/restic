Introduction
============

restic is a backup program that is fast, efficient and secure. Detailed
information can be found in [the documentation](doc/index.md) and [the user
manual](doc/Manual.md). The [design document](doc/Design.md) lists the
technical background and gives detailed information about the structure of the
repository and the data saved therein.

The latest documentation can be viewed online at
<https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest>. On the bottom left corner there is
a menu that allows switching to the documentation and user manual for the
latest released version.

Build restic
============

Install Go/Golang (at least version 1.6), then run `go run build.go`,
afterwards you'll find the binary in the current directory:

    $ go run build.go

    $ ./restic --help
    Usage:
      restic [OPTIONS] <command>
    [...]

More documentation can be found in the [user manual](doc/Manual.md).

At the moment, the only tested compiler for restic is the official Go compiler.
Building restic with gccgo may work, but is not supported.
