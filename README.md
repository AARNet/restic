Restic Design Principles
========================

Restic is a program that does backups right and was designed with the following
principles in mind:

 * Easy: Doing backups should be a frictionless process, otherwise you might be
   tempted to skip it.  Restic should be easy to configure and use, so that, in
   the event of a data loss, you can just restore it. Likewise,
   restoring data should not be complicated.

 * Fast: Backing up your data with restic should only be limited by your
   network or hard disk bandwidth so that you can backup your files every day.
   Nobody does backups if it takes too much time. Restoring backups should only
   transfer data that is needed for the files that are to be restored, so that
   this process is also fast.

 * Verifiable: Much more important than backup is restore, so restic enables
   you to easily verify that all data can be restored.

 * Secure: Restic uses cryptography to guarantee confidentiality and integrity
   of your data. The location the backup data is stored is assumed not to be a
   trusted environment (e.g. a shared space where others like system
   administrators are able to access your backups). Restic is built to secure
   your data against such attackers.

 * Efficient: With the growth of data, additional snapshots should only take
   the storage of the actual increment. Even more, duplicate data should be
   de-duplicated before it is actually written to the storage back end to save
   precious backup space.


Build restic
============

Install Go/Golang (at least version 1.3), then run `go run build.go`,
afterwards you'll find the binary in the current directory:

    $ go run build.go

    $ ./restic --help
    Usage:
      restic [OPTIONS] <command>
    [...]

More documentation can be found on the [website](https://restic.github.io),
especially in the [user manual](https://restic.github.io/manual).

Compatibility
=============

Backward compatibility for backups is important so that our users are always
able to restore saved data. Therefore restic follows [Semantic
Versioning](http://semver.org) to clearly define which versions are compatible.
The repository and data structures contained therein are considered the "Public
API" in the sense of Semantic Versioning. This goes for all released versions
of restic, this may not be the case for the master branch.

We guarantee backward compatibility of all repositories within one major version;
as long as we do not increment the major version, data can be read and restored.
We strive to be fully backward compatible to all prior versions.

Contribute and Documentation
============================

Contributions are welcome! More information can be found in
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md). A document describing the design of
restic and the data structures stored on the back end is contained in
[`doc/Design.md`](doc/Design.md).
The development environment is described in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).
