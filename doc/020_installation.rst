Official Binaries
*****************

Stable Releases
===============

You can download the latest stable release versions of restic from the `restic
release page <https://github.com/restic/restic/releases/latest>`__. These builds
are considered stable and releases are made regularly in a controlled manner.

There's both pre-compiled binaries for different platforms as well as the source
code available for download. Just download and run the one matching your system.

Unstable Builds
===============

Another option is to use the latest builds for the master branch, available on
the `restic beta download site
<https://beta.restic.net/?sort=time&order=desc>`__. These too are pre-compiled
and ready to run, and a new version is built every time a push is made to the
master branch.

Windows
=======

On Windows, put the `restic.exe` into `%SystemRoot%\System32` to use restic
in scripts without the need for absolute paths to the binary. This requires
Admin rights.

Docker Container
****************

We're maintaining a bare docker container with just a few files and the restic
binary, you can get it with `docker pull` like this:

.. code-block:: console

    $ docker pull restic/restic

.. note::
   | Another docker container which offers more configuration options is
   | available as a contribution (Thank you!). You can find it at
   | https://github.com/Lobaro/restic-backup-docker

From Source
***********

restic is written in the Go programming language and you need at least
Go version 1.9. Building restic may also work with older versions of Go,
but that's not supported. See the `Getting
started <https://golang.org/doc/install>`__ guide of the Go project for
instructions how to install Go.

In order to build restic from source, execute the following steps:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/restic/restic
    [...]

    $ 

    $ go run build.go

You can easily cross-compile restic for all supported platforms, just
supply the target OS and platform via the command-line options like this
(for Windows and FreeBSD respectively):

.. code-block:: console

    $ go run build.go --goos windows --goarch amd64

    $ go run build.go --goos freebsd --goarch 386

    $ go run build.go --goos linux --goarch arm --goarm 6
    
The resulting binary is statically linked and does not require any
libraries.

At the moment, the only tested compiler for restic is the official Go
compiler. Building restic with gccgo may work, but is not supported.

Autocompletion
**************

Restic can write out man pages and bash/zsh compatible autocompletion scripts:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./restic generate --help

    The "generate" command writes automatically generated files like the man pages
    and the auto-completion files for bash and zsh).

    Usage:
      restic generate [command] [flags]

    Flags:
          --bash-completion file   write bash completion file
      -h, --help                   help for generate
          --man directory          write man pages to directory
          --zsh-completion file    write zsh completion file

Example for using sudo to write a bash completion script directly to the system-wide location:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo ./restic generate --bash-completion /etc/bash_completion.d/restic
    writing bash completion file to /etc/bash_completion.d/restic
