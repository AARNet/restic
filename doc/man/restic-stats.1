.SH NAME
.PP
restic\-stats \- Scan the repository and show basic statistics


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBrestic stats [flags] [snapshot\-ID]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The "stats" command walks one or all snapshots in a repository and
accumulates statistics about the data stored therein. It reports on
the number of unique files and their sizes, according to one of
the counting modes as given by the \-\-mode flag.

.PP
If no snapshot is specified, all snapshots will be considered. Some
modes make more sense over just a single snapshot, while others
are useful across all snapshots, depending on what you are trying
to calculate.

.PP
The modes are:

.RS
.IP \(bu 2
restore\-size: (default) Counts the size of the restored files.
.IP \(bu 2
files\-by\-contents: Counts total size of files, where a file is
considered unique if it has unique contents.
.IP \(bu 2
raw\-data: Counts the size of blobs in the repository, regardless of
how many files reference them.
.IP \(bu 2
blobs\-per\-file: A combination of files\-by\-contents and raw\-data.
.IP \(bu 2
Refer to the online manual for more details about each mode.
