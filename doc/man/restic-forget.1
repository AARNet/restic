.SH NAME
.PP
restic\-forget \- forget removes snapshots from the repository


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBrestic forget [flags] [snapshot ID] [...]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The "forget" command removes snapshots according to a policy. Please note that
this command really only deletes the snapshot object in the repository, which
is a reference to data stored there. In order to remove this (now unreferenced)
data after 'forget' was run successfully, see the 'prune' command.
