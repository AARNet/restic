restic is a backup program that is fast, efficient and secure. On the left you
can find an overview of the documentation. The project's homepage is
<https://restic.github.io>, the source code repository can be found on GitHub
at the URL <https://github.com/restic/restic>.

The documentation you're currently viewing may not match the version of restic
you have installed. If you cloned the repository manually, you can find the
right documentation in the directory `doc/`. If you're viewing this online at
<https://restic.readthedocs.org>, there is a small menu at the bottom left of
this page, where you can select the version.
